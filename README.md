# Overview of Javascript CRD Tutorials

Welcome! These tutorials are designed to help you learn how to create, read, and delete data on your browser's local storage with JavaScript using the source-code editor Visual Studio Code (VSC) -- 3 of the 4 major functions for manipulating data, CRUD.

This document covers the following topics:

- Creating data on local storage
- Reading data on local storage
- Deleting data on local storage

## How We Collaborated Together

Every Wednesday, we were given time to work on the user guide assignment. However, beyond these scheduled periods, our primary mode of communication was through Discord, which we utilized to discuss on the various sections of the user guide.

In order to collaborate on the documentation, we used Git and GitHub. Using these tools allowed us to collaborate on the documentation together, merge changes, and keep track of progress in real-time.

## How We Created Our Guide

We used our knowledge of CRD, which was obtained during our COMP 1537 - Web Development course, to create this guide.

### Using MKDocs

The reason for selecting [Material for MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) was due to its high degree of customization, which gave us the ability to customize the appearance of our user guide to our liking.

### Using Visual Studio Code

We decided to use VSCode to write in our markdown files since it has a built-in markdown preview feature that allowed us to view the appearance of our user guide in real-time as we worked on it.

### Readability

We made sure our writing was easy to understand by focusing on being clear, concise, and comprehensive. We chose simple language, used straightforward sentences, and included all necessary information in a way that was easy for the reader to follow.

To provide readers with an outline of the topic before diving into the steps, an overview was included in each tutorial. 

To summarize what the reader would have accomplished by following the guide, a conclusion was added at the end.

Throughout the tutorials, there will be messages designed to give you relevant information.

### Tone

We wanted our user guide to be accessible to readers who may be new to coding or technical documentation. To achieve this, we took steps to make our writing style more approachable and easy to understand. We decided to adopt a relaxed style of writing to make the content feel less intimidating.

## Conclusion

This document went over our understanding of CRD in Javascript, which was something we learnt in our COMP 1537 - Web Development course.

We were given an opportunity to practice writing clear and concise instructions for user's to follow, which is a skill that can be applied to in the future.
