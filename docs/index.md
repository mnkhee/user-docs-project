## Target Audience

These tutorials are targeted towards people who are just starting out with front-end web development -- however, people of all levels may follow alongside the tutorials.
<br> **People unfamiliar with HTML and JavaScript should copy the code blocks we provide, while people who are familiar with those languages may code side-by-side with our tutorial. The primary HTML tags that experienced users should know about are tags such as [script](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_script_src.asp), [button](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_button.asp), and [input](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_input.asp).**
