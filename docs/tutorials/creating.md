# Creating Unique Data

## Overview

This section will focus on creating and storing unique data on your web browser.

## Setup

1. Create a folder on your computer (the folder can have any name).
2. Open VSC.
3. On the top left corner of VSC, click on File > Open Folder, and select your newly created folder.
    <br> ![open-folder](/images/creating/open-folder.png)

4. Create an HTML file by clicking on File > New File..., and name it index.html.
    <br> ![create-file](/images/creating/create-file.png)

5. Create a Javascript file using File > New File; name it index.js (**NOTE:** it is recommended to name this file the same as your HTML file).

    !!! note "Info"
        You can name the JavaScript file any valid filename, however it is recommended to name it with the same name as the HTML file you plan to link it to. <br>
        For the remainder of this tutorial, we will be naming variables and files

## Creating and Storing Data

1. Open the HTML file by double clicking it on the explorer menu. If the menu is not visible, click on View > Explorer.
    <br> ![explorer-menu](/images/creating/explorer-menu.png)

    !!! tip "Important"
        From steps 2 to 6, you may choose to follow the steps or you may copy the code block at the end of step 6.

2. In the code editor window, type '!', and hit enter.

    By this point, you should be seeing a template autogenerated by VSC.
    <br> ![exclamation-two](/images/creating/exclamation-2.png)
    If it did not autogenerate, feel free to copy and paste the following block onto your HTML file.

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>

    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>

    </body>
    </html>
    ```

3. In the HTML document head, insert a blank line after line 7.
4. Link your JavaScript file you created during the tutorial setup.
5. Create an input tag within the body of the HTML file. Give it an id attribute 'createInput'.
6. Create a button tag right below your input tag. Give it an id attribute 'createButton', and put any text inside it.

    ```html
        <!DOCTYPE html>

    <html lang="en">

    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <input id="createInput"></input>
        <button id="createButton">Click me!</button>
    </body>

    </html>
    ```

7. In your JavaScript file, create a function with the following code block:

    ```js
    function submitInput() {
    var input = document.getElementById("createInput").value;
    localStorage.setItem("createInput", JSON.stringify(input));
    }
    ```

8. Open your HTML file by dragging it onto a compatible browser.
9. Type something into the input box.
10. Hit the button to submit the unique data into the browserâ€™s local storage.

## Conclusion

by the end of this section, you will have successfully created and stored data on your web browsers local storage.
